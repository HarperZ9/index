"""The front-page artwork stays true to the words it illustrates.

A picture in a README is never diffed, so it drifts from the text silently:
somebody edits a stage name, nobody re-renders, and the diagram now describes
a version of the tool that no longer exists. Here the picture is a pure
function of a spec that IS diffable, and this re-renders it and compares
bytes.

The truncation test is the one that earns its place. Card notes are wrapped to
three lines and the wrapper drops the rest, so an edited sentence can lose its
ending in the drawing while reading fine in the spec.
