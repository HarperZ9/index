"""The README card fits the columns it is drawn in, and says one thing.

A card is a table rendered to SVG: a key column, a value column, and a note
column beside them, with a footnote under the rule. None of the three is
clipped by the renderer, so a sentence that outgrows its column draws over the
one next to it and every other check stays green. These measure the drawing
rather than read the spec.

The measuring is done here, from scripts/face-metrics.json, and not by calling
the renderer. An earlier version asked repo_card how wide its own text was, so
the check and the drawing shared one guess and agreed with each other whatever
that guess said. Four cards shipped past the right rule under a green suite.
This walks each measured face on its own instead, and asks whether the line
fits in that face, so the two can now disagree.

Everything here settles whether the card fits its columns and matches its
spec. Whether the card is TRUE of what this tool writes into a map is a
different question, and tests/test_gitmeta.py and tests/test_scan.py settle
that one by driving the code.
